Here, a random number will be generated by the game. There are four crystals and each has been given specific points.You need to click on the crystals such that you make your score EXACT equal to the target score. If your score increases than the target, you loose the game. Once you win or loose a game, the game will reset and the points associated with the crystals would also reset.
